 Pancake Problem with AI

*Formulated  and  developed  a  solution  to  the  pancake  problem  by  applying uninformed and informed search algorithms: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Depth Limited Search, Iterative Deepening Search, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Best First Search, and A* Search.

Pancake problem: This  famous  problem  is  usually  stated  as  follows: Pancake  sorting is  sorting  a  disordered  stack  of pancakes  in  order  of  size  when  a spatula can  be  inserted  at  any  point  in  the  stack  and  used  to  flip  all pancakes above it.

1) simpleai library is used.
2) Program has a simple console-based menu which takes the number of pancakes(𝑁)from the user. The smallest pancake has number 0 and the largest one has N-1. 
3) Two options to the user for the initial ordering of 𝑁 pancakes: 
 a.The program randomly generates a permutation of𝑁pancakes as the initial ordering. 
 b.The  initial  ordering of 𝑁 pancakes  is  determined  by  the  user.
